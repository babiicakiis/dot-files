# Kevgo's config files


## Installation

- clone this repo to your computer

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:kevgo/dot-files.git .config
  ```

- run `.config/install/install.sh`


## Maintenance

Once a day,
when opening a new terminal window
it pulls changes from GitHub.
It also prints uncommitted files in the `.config` folder.


## Files

All files here belong into the `~/.config` folder, except these ones:
- __bin_folder:__ this folder should be symlinked into `~/bin`
- __home_dir_files:__ these files should be located in the root directory
- __install:__ installation files
